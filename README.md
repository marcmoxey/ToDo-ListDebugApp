# To-Do List Application

A simple to-do list application that allows users to add, remove, and view tasks. This project focuses on using breakpoints to debug task management logic.

## Features
- Add tasks to a list.
- Remove tasks from the list.
- View all tasks.
- Uses breakpoints to inspect the list after each operation.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Set breakpoints in the code (e.g., after adding or removing a task).
4. Run the program in debug mode (`F5`).
5. Use the **Locals** window to inspect the task list.

## Debugging Tips
- Set breakpoints to inspect the task list after each operation.
- Debug edge cases, such as removing a task from an empty list.
